Here are some key features of the tool:
ðŸ”¹ Network Packet Sniffing: The tool captures and processes network packets, allowing for real-time monitoring and analysis of network traffic. This is essential for understanding network behavior and detecting potential security threats.

ðŸ”¹ Packet Analysis: The tool identifies and extracts key information from each packet, including the source and destination IP addresses, protocol, and port numbers for TCP packets. This detailed analysis helps in understanding the nature and flow of network traffic.

ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Monitoring: The tool operates in real-time, continuously sniffing packets and providing immediate insights into network activities. This is crucial for proactive security monitoring and incident response.

ðŸ”¹ Protocol Handling: The tool differentiates between different protocols (e.g., TCP), ensuring accurate and detailed logging of packet information. This makes it versatile for monitoring various types of network traffic.

ðŸ”¹ Practical Application: This project demonstrates the practical application of Python for network security, showcasing the ability to implement network monitoring tools that can help in identifying and mitigating security threats.
